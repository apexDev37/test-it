- AWS RDS & Elastic Beanstalk
- Software Deployment Automation with Github Actions
- Software Deployment Monitoring with Slack
- Unit and Integration Testing

This course focus on teaching you the process needed to build your own apps and deploy to real users using real software development techniques and skills. The skills gained at the end of this can be applied immediately on your own projects, university projects and at your work place.
